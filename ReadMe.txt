How to run the program?


1. Please enter desired start and goal position instead of the default value in jain_vaibhav.py

2. The program does everything from path finding to video making in one file so patience is advised while it runs.
   For the default goal position, the program ran for 5-10 minutes.

3. NOTE that there are two videos and two images attached for review.
   NOTE - Before running pyhthon file review the videos.

4. Please feel free to contact me for any questions.
